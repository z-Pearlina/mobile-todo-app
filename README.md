## üöÄ Local Setup & Installation

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

### 1. Prerequisites

* Node.js (v18 or later)
* npm or yarn
* **Expo Go** app on your physical iOS or Android device

### 2. Clone & Install Dependencies

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name

# Install all dependencies
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### 3. Firebase Configuration

Create a `firebaseConfig.js` file in the project's root directory. This file holds your private Firebase credentials and **should never be committed to Git**.

```javascript
// firebaseConfig.js
import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
import { getFirestore } from "firebase/firestore";
import { getAuth } from "firebase/auth";

const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
  projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
  storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
  messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
  appId: "YOUR_APP_ID"
};

// Initialize Firebase
const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
export const db = getFirestore(app);
export const auth = getAuth(app);
```
